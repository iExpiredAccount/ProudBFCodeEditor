        <h2>Personal Note </h2>
        <p>
            This dish was a canteen staple in secondary school. 
            <br> I used to detest the taste of this because it was too vinegary, 
            but it was brought to my attention several years later that 
            <br>vinegar was as much a preservative as it was for taste.
